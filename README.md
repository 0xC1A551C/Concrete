production server. The fork is based off of aikar's EMC framework found here:

### License
The PATCHES-LICENSE file describes the license for api & server patches, 
found in ./patches/api and ./patches/server.

Everything else is licensed under the MIT license.

The scripts are copied from https://github.com/electronicboy/byof, so
I do not own them.
